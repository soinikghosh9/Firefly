**Short description**  
Firefly is a VR-infused robotic exo-suit designed to deliver engaging, automated physical therapy for stroke rehabilitation. The system combines an interactive XR environment, wearable haptics, force/motion sensing, and AI-driven exercise optimization to improve patient motivation, provide real-time feedback, and enable remote / telemetric therapy.  
**Status:** Ongoing (IIT-BHU, Pragati Hackathon 2023 — 2nd Runner Up).  
**Role:** Co-researcher (hardware prototyping, signal processing & AI).

## Key features
- Immersive VR rehabilitation environments for motivating, task-based therapy.  
- Soft/rigid exo-suit actuators with haptic feedback for guided movement assistance.  
- Integrated sensors (FSR, flex sensors, IMU, webcam) for real-time performance tracking.  
- Wireless telemetry for remote monitoring and clinician dashboards.  
- Lightweight AI models for exercise adaptation, progress scoring, and safety checks.  
- Exportable clinician reports and session logs for longitudinal tracking.

## Why Firefly?
Traditional physiotherapy often suffers from low patient engagement, limited access, and lack of quantifiable real-time feedback. Firefly addresses these gaps by combining XR gamification with wearable robotics and sensing to make rehab more engaging, measurable, and accessible.
